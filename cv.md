### Summary 
I consider myself as a responsible, hardworking and open-minded person. I always try to improve my skills and analyze mistakes. I am able to adapt effectively to challenging situations and remain calm in stressful moments. I enjoy working as a team member and always try to find a common language with people. My key priorities are quality, punctuality and responsible approach to work.  

For me programming, especially Front-end, is something truly exciting and motivating. It allows us to create something out of nothing. IT has become one of the most progressive industries in the world and to be part of it is something that really motivates me. I am ready to put in the time, dedication and commitment to succeed and achieve my goals.
